The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

as shown here.

# High level Overview {#overview}

The ATSSS service is defined several 3GPP documents that reference several
other documents. A detailed presentation of this service is outside the
scope of this section.

To understand the operation of the ATSSS service, it is useful to consider the
reference environment shown in the figure below. A host, called A in the
figure, is attached to two different access networks (Net1 and Net2).
These networks can be managed by different organizations.
A second host, called B in the figure, 
is connected to the Internet. B does not use multipath transport protocols
while A would like to be able to use its two access networks to reach B. To
enable A to use its two paths efficiently, a possible solution is to use
a midpoint node, called M in the figure, so that multipath transport is
used between A and M while regular (single path) transport is used
between A and B.

Several use cases correspond to this environment. A first use case are the
mobile devices like smartphones that are equipped with a cellular and
a Wi-Fi interface.
A second use case are the hybrid access networks where A is a CPE router that
is attached to fixed (e.g. xDSL) and wireless (e.g. cellular) networks.

In this document, we focus on the first use case, but most of the discussion
applies to the second one as well.

The two scenarios that we consider in this document are:
- the failure of one access network that forces all data to switch to the other access network
- the possibility of splitting the transmission of the data over the two access networks even if they have different characteristics (delay, bandwidth, congestion)

## Data Plane Encapsulations

A variety of encapsulation schemes are used in 5GS. It is out of the scope of this document to provide a comprehensive description of the usage of such encapsulations. This section focuses exclusively on highlighting 5GS encapsulation designs that are important to take into account for the design of an efficient ATSSS solution.

In particular, GPRS Tunneling Protocol for the user plane (GTP-U) is used between RAN and UPF to support tunneling user data (see {{fig-encap-1}}).

{: #fig-encap-1 title="User Plane Protocol Stack"}

When the UE is connected to the 5GC via a non-3GPP access network, the following figure ({{fig-encap-2}}) depicts a typical protocol stack that should be used by the UE. In particular, IKEv2/IPsec are used to connect to a 5GC via a dedicated interconnection node. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+--------+===========================
|Payload |    Exchange data with a PDN 
+--------+              via a non-3GPP 
|  IP    |              access network 
+--------+=====================  
|  GRE   |   Establish a secure
+--------+     association with
|Inner IP|  a dedicated gateway
+--------+ to graft to a 5GC by 
|  IPsec | means of IKEv2/IPsec               
+--------+=============
|   IP   |   Connect to 
+--------+    an access
|   L2   |      network
+--------+ 
|   L1   |

# Carrying bytestreams over different access networks {#bytestreams}


# Carrying packets over different access networks {#packets}


# Conclusion {#conclusion}

Based on the two above questions, it should be clear that MPQUIC could
cover both cases.
